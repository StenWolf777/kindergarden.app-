"""
Salary deductions from staff attendance.

Rules (agreed with the kindergarten):
- A day's pay is base salary / working days in the month (Mon-Fri minus holidays).
- An unexcused absence ('ABSENT') deducts one day's pay; 'EXCUSED' is paid in full.
- An unmarked past working day counts as an absence.
- A late arrival deducts the org's late-penalty percentage of one day's pay.
- Nothing before the org's deduction start date or the employee's hire date is counted,
  and today only counts once it has been marked.
